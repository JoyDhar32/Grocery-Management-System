                                At UTS Grocery, we are committed to protecting the privacy and security of our
                                customers' personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and
                                safeguard the information you provide while using our website or mobile application.
                                Information Collection: We may collect personal information such as name, address,
                                email, and payment details when you place an order or create an account on our platform.
                                We may also collect non-personal information like cookies and browsing data to enhance
                                your shopping experience.
                                Information Use: The personal information we collect is primarily used to process and
                                deliver your orders, improve our services, and provide customer support. We may also use
                                your information to send promotional offers or newsletters if you have opted in to
                                receive them.
                                Information Security: We employ industry-standard security measures to protect your
                                personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
                                However, no data transmission over the internet or electronic storage method is 100%
                                secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
                                Information Sharing: We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third
                                parties for marketing purposes. However, we may share your information with trusted
                                service providers who assist us in operating our business, as required by law, or with
                                your consent.
                                Policy Updates: We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy periodically, and any
                                changes will be posted on our website. By using UTS Grocery, you acknowledge and agree
